# Asteroids with Python and Pyglet

I completed this project in 2013 as part of an open-ended high school research project. I have updated it to work under Python 3 and removed the embedded copy of Pyglet.

It is based on the [Pyglet Tutorial](https://steveasleep.com/pyglettutorial.html) by Steve Landey (AKA. Steve Johnson)

# Quick Start

```sh
pip3 install pyglet
python3 source/asteroids.py
```
